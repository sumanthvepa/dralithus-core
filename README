Dralithus is intended to be a command line tool to 'hydrate' a network of
virtual machines.

 Dralithus takes a configuration file specified either by the
--config / -f option or if no option is specified, it will look for a
file named network.yaml in the current working directory.

Release 0:
Dralithus will read the contents of the YAML file and print instructions
to create the VMs specified in it.
