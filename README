Dralithus is intended to be a command line tool to 'hydrate' a network of
virtual machines and containers to deploy applications to various environment


Release 0:
When invoked as follows:
dralithus deploy --environment='local' sample

The program should print the following:
{
  "application": "sample"
  "environment": "local"
}

# The following are notes for a future release
Release N:
The following command should work:

dralithus deploy --environment='local' sample

This will deploy the application sample to the local environment

In the code above sample refers to the name of an sample
CRUD application that stores key/value pairs and allows
visitors to add, delete or modify such keys and values.



For this work, the user must provide the following configuration
files:

environments/local.yaml:
  This describes virtual machines available in the environment
  and the purpose they may be used for.

applications/sample.yaml:
  This describes source code repository that contains
  the code and files that can build the code

configuration/sample-local.yaml:
  This describes the parameters, if any, that need to be passed
  to the build system to build for the environment specified
  by local.yaml

  In addition it describes and points to any data, including
  secrets that need to be passed to various components of
  the application

It is important to note that release0 might *only* be able
to deploy the sample application, and that only to the
specific 'local.yaml'  environment. It might make
assumptions about the environment that are valid
only for the primary developer of the application
(svepa@milestone42.com)

The local environment is intended to represent a development
environment that developer might have. Specifically, 
we assume that we are deploying to a host running
almalinux:9 which has already been provisioned correctly
with docker.
